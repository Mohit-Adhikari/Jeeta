	<h3>Preface</h3>
	<p class="preface"> What you are seeing are words emulated through codes. Hopefully, these words will bring forth the revelation of our deceitful and yet truthful minds. But for me, this is a reminiscence of an individual who once called me her son. She was taken from me because of her own innocent brain. The same brain that persuaded her that I would be better if she isn't here with me. Miss you, Mother.</p>
	<h2>About Jeeta </h2>
	<p class="about">Whatever the requirements for the advancement of mental health may be, Jeeta will always have its core purpose to meet those requirements. It is a library for those who are sure they've known it all. It is a stage for those who know nothing and a podium for those who've lost it all.</p>
